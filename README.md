We use Minio to store all our ipa/apk files and pdf reports that gets auto-nenerated. We are an Enterprise startups and offer On-Premise and Private-Cloud installations of our cloud-based scanner. We have deployed our code base on AWS, Google, Azure, multiple On-Premise installations and Private Cloud. Before Mino came along - we had to write and maintain Python libraries for each platform and maintain it. Some of the changes that we make cannot be even tested - because its deployed on-premise where we dont have access to. Thankfully, we came across Minio. Now we just install minio everywhere and forget about storage. Minio Rocks!
* [rclone](http://rclone.org) - "rsync for cloud storage".  Rclone is a command application to sync files to and from cloud storage systems and it works well with minio.  Check out [rclone's s3 docs](http://rclone.org/s3/) to see how.
* [BackupHive](https://www.backuphive.nl) - Providing online backup services from The Netherlands with Minio as a back-end S3 compatible server for storage and retrieval of files. Minio is very scalable, uses almost no resources itself and is easy to maintain.
