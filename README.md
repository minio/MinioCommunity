We have deployed our code base on AWS, Google, Azure, multiple on-premise installations and private cloud. Before Mino came along - we had to write and maintain Python libraries for each platform and maintain them. Some of the changes that we make cannot be even tested - because it is deployed on-premise which we dont have access to. Thankfully, we came across Minio. Now we just install minio everywhere and forget about storage. Minio Rocks!
