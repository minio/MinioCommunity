### Cloud/SaaS Applications
* [Appknox](https://www.appknox.com/) - Appknox detects & addresses vulnerabilities in mobile apps within minutes. Managing storage was a nightmare for us before Minio came along. We use Minio to store all our ipa/apk files and pdf reports that gets auto-nenerated. We are an enterprise startup and we offer on-premise and private-cloud installations of our cloud-based scanner. We have deployed our code base on AWS, Google, Azure, multiple on-premise installations and private cloud. Before Mino came along - we had to write and maintain Python libraries for each platform and maintain them. Some of the changes that we make cannot be even tested - because it is deployed on-premise which we dont have access to. Thankfully, we came across Minio. Now we just install minio everywhere and forget about storage. Minio Rocks!
